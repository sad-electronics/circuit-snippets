  # Circuit Snippets 
  
* #### Why did I create this repository?   
  Redrawing the commonly used circuits ca be frustrating, so I made this repo to store and share them. 

* #### Which EDAs are supported? 
  While I use both Kicad and Eagle, this repository will focus on Kicad.

* #### How does it work? 
  The Kicad PCB files from this repository can be imported via the `Add hierarchical sheet` option. 
 
 * #### What about the PCB Layout? 
  Unfortunately Kicad doesnt support a simple way of importing layout blocks at the moment.
